title: "ComputeSDK: Secure Code Execution Anywhere"
description: ""
---

ComputeSDK provides a unified interface for running code in secure, isolated environments across multiple cloud providers. Whether you're building AI applications, developer tools, or serverless backends, ComputeSDK makes it easy to execute untrusted code safely.

## Core Concepts

### Sandbox: Your Isolated Workspace
A sandbox is an isolated environment where your code executes securely. Each sandbox provides:
- Isolated filesystem
- Network restrictions
- Resource limits
- Clean environment for each execution

### Providers: Powering Your Sandboxes
ComputeSDK supports multiple execution backends (see providers for details)

[Configure your provider →](/docs/reference/configuration)

## Key Features

### 1. Run Node.js, Python, and more
Execute code in multiple languages with automatic runtime detection.
